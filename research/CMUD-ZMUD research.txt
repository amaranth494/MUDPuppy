CMUD Features:
 Fast and Easy Scripting

Compiled scripts are 2 to 10 times faster than zMUD.
Vast majority of zMUD scripts run without any changes in CMUD.
Compiling is performed behind the scenes. Your scripts just magically run faster.
Scripts are saved to a new database format...no more corrupted settings!
Scripts are automatically saved, even if your computer crashes.
New scripting features such as Local variables, #SWITCH and Named Arguments make scripts faster and easier to understand.
New script editor has better and faster syntax highlighting, code folding, line numbers, and many other features expected from a programmer's editor.
Integrated support for the Lua scripting language for very high-performance scripting.
Works with any other Windows scripting language. Scripting languages can be freely mixed, even within the same window. Built-in syntax highlighting for Lua, VBScript, JavaScript, Perl, Python, Ruby.

 Automatic Mapping

MapperCMUD and zMUD are the only MUD clients designed to create automatic maps as you move around the MUD on most any MUD that you want to play (doesn't require MUD support). Don't be fooled by cheap imitations!
Double-click on any room on the map to let CMUD compute the shortest path and automatically send the speedwalk directions to the game.
Room properties allow you to change visual appearance of rooms, and to assign scripts to specific rooms.
Maps can be easily edited and support custom room exits and portals.
New mapper in latest CMUD 3.x BETA allows you to track multiple locations on the same map.
Graphical enhancements such as a background image, custom room shapes, icons, and more can be added to your map.

ZMUD Features:

Feature	
Description
Recently Added Features

Spell Checking

	
As-you-type spell checking. Misspelled words are underlined with a red wiggle. You can right-click to get a suggestion of correct words. You can add words to your own dictionary, and even auto-correct your common mispellings. Dictionaries for many different languages are available.
PERL-based Regular Expressions
	
Uses the Open Source PCRE Perl Regular Expression Library.  ALL Triggers now run from two to ten times faster.  Full Regular Expression support is provided, including captured substrings, named substrings, and nested wildcards.  Not only does every zMUD user benefit from the speed improvements, but advanced users can use the regular expressions for even more powerful triggers.  Regular expression conditions are fully supported by multi-state triggers, providing more triggering power than any other MUD client.
Database-driven Automapper
	
The Automapper module in zMUD has been rewritten from scratch to use an SQL database engine (using the MDAC database software that comes with Windows).  This is the same mapping engine used in zMapper and zExplorer.  zMUD map databases can be customized using the external zMapper program (available seperately) to graphically enhance your maps.  Maps enhanced with zMapper can be displayed within zMUD when zMapper is installed using the automatic zMapper plugin for zMUD.
The speed and stability of the mapper has been greatly improved.  When you double-click on a zone, the zone is now loaded instantly.  You can now speedwalk across multiple zones as easily as you speedwalk within a single zone.  Speedwalk calculations are incredibly fast compared to any previous mapper.  Options have been added for sending only a certain number of directions at once for MUDs that restrict speedwalking.  Custom exit commands have been improved and can be mapped to standard directions for faster keypad walking through special exits.  Portal commands have been added to support teleportation spells.

Windows XP Themes
	
The entire look and feel of zMUD has been updated for the modern Windows XP operating system.  All users of zMUD will benefit from the more colorful icons used in zMUD.  For Windows XP users, zMUD fully supports the XP Themes so that zMUD will look and feel like other applications on your computer.
Trigger Wizard
	
Use the new wizard to create common triggers for your MUD.  Advanced users can write their own custom wizards to help people create MUD-specific triggers. [More detailed information]
Flexible Scripting
	
Now you can write scripts in ANY scripting language supported by Windows.  Using the Windows Scripting Engine, you can write scripts in VBScript, JavaScript, or any other language that you install that supports this Microsoft engine (such as PerlScript).  You can freely mix scripting languages in your files using the zMUD %mss function.  zMUD Scripting is still the fastest and most optimized scripting language for MUD playing, but if you don't want to learn zMUD Scripting, you can now use your favorite scripting language instead. [zMUD COM object model documentation]
Multi-state Triggers
	
The most powerful trigger system just got better: multi-state triggers.  Add multiple conditions to your triggers for handling multiple lines, or other complex situations.  It's a full "state machine" that you can control to provide powerful processing of MUD output. [More detailed information]
FTP
	
zMUD includes a full FTP client.  Using the new #FTP command you can now download files to and from your MUD.  You can even download a file directly into the zMUD Editor, and then Save your changes and have the file automatically sent back to the MUD.  Great for world-building.
Simutronic GSL Support

 
zMUD is the ONLY 3rd party MUD client that officially supports the Simutronics GSL protocol used in MUDs such as Gemstone and Dragonrealms.  This support also provides inline image support via the MXP <IMAGE> tag, and Pueblo emulation for those MUDs that still support the old Pueblo protocol.
Major or Unique zMUD Features
Automatic Mapping
mapper.gif (3790 bytes)	
Even without zMapper, you can create a graphical map as you walk around the MUD. A revolutionary feature for a MUD client!  Don't be fooled by imitations...zMUD was the first MUD client to have an automapper, and it still has more features and compatibility with more MUDs than any other MUD client.
Map handles 8 standard directions plus custom teleport directions, doors, multiple levels, one-way links, room colors, multiple zones, custom labels, and much more.

Double click on a room and it will automatically speedwalk you to the room from wherever you are using the shortest path, even across zones!

Redesigned Settings Editor
	
The Settings Editor (used to create and edit aliases, triggers, keyboard macros, etc) has been redesigned to work more like Windows Explorer.  Classes are now folders and can be nested and contain other settings.  Setting type (alias, trigger, etc) are like file types.  Multiple windows can be opened and settings can be dragged and dropped between windows to easily exchange settings with others. 
[Read more about Settings Editor]

This is an evolving open specification that several MUDs are contributing to.  Unlike previous attempts to bring HTML to MUDs, MXP has built in security and it tailored specifically to telnet sessions, rather than strictly adhering to the HTML standard. 
[Read More about MXP]
MUD Client Compression Protocol
The Mud Client Compression Protocol (MCCP) allows the MUD to compress the text sent to the client.  Your compression savings can be monitored within zMUD.  More compression means zMUD can handle more MUD output for faster text scrolling.  Especially useful during battles. 
[Read more about MCCP]
